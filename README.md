# InternIntelligence_BIG_DATA_ANALYSIS
I have created a model to go through the x-ray images of different patients to classify whether the patient is affected with covid-19, viral pneumonia or normal patient. the data set i have used is a big data downloaded from kaggle for the analysis.
The model gives you the key results for further use like following csv files and one json file
diagnosis_distribution.csv
cluster_analysis.csv
feature_importance.csv
model_predictions.csv
analysis_summary.json
